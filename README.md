## The Story

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at Texas A&M University. Beyond technology, I also love aviation and have a curiosity of how airports and planes operate. I love spending time travelling and planespotting. I have been to Asia, Europe, and of course North America. I love seaching information about flights, airports, and aircraft. Hence, the reason AvGeeks was born.
